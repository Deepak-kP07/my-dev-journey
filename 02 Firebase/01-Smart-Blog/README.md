## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A Firebase project. You can create one for free at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-blog.git
    cd smart-blog
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase configuration:**
    *   In the Firebase Console, go to your Project Settings and create a new Web App.
    *   Copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your Firebase configuration details to the `.env` file. **Important:** For Vite, all environment variable names must start with `VITE_`.

    ```env
    # .env
    VITE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
    VITE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
    VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
    VITE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase in the app:**
    *   Ensure your `src/firebase.js` file is correctly reading these environment variables:
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY,
      // ... and so on
    };
    ```

5.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    *   In the Firebase Console, enable **Authentication** (with Email/Password and Google providers).
    *   Set up **Cloud Firestore** (start in test mode for local development).
